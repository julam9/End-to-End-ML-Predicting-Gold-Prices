## 📖 Introduction
This project is my first end to end machine learning project. Through this project, I learn how end to end works along with machine learning. I choose the topic of forecasting gold price since gold become hot topic and the price is rising quite significantly. 

## 🗂️ Project Structure
- scr/ : Contains module used for end to end process, like data collection, data preprocessing, data validation, model building, model saving, model loading, model evaluation
- model/ : Contains saved model, the model named with timestamp of model constructed
- notebook/ : Contains notebook that used to test the code and do some exploration
- .env : Contains API Key from Alpha Vantage to collect data
- .gitignore : Contains files that won't be pushed to github
- poetry.lock : Contains store project metadata, build system information, and dependency specifications 
- pyproject.toml :  Contains package version needed to be installed 
- pipeline_validation.py : Script to check if the entire end to end process is working
- train.py : Script to train and save model
